## Data Visualisation:    

This mini project stemmed from a lab class at CodeClan in Glasgow. Data was retrieved from the Rest Countries API (https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/all) using an XMLHttpRequest, event listeners and callbacks. Highchart Chart objects (barChart, pieChart and wordCloud) were created using JavaScript then populated from the Rest Countries data using the Highchart API (http://code.highcharts.com/highcharts.js).  


## Built With:  
* JavaScipt   
* Rest Countries API (https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/all)  
* Highcharts API (http://code.highcharts.com/highcharts.js)  


## Authors  
* Peter McCready - Initial work
